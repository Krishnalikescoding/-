Hello, my name is Krishna Gupta, and I am a first-year BTCSE student. I’ve built the foundation for an exciting "Guess the Number" game, programmed in C, where the system randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it based on hints like "Try Higher Number" or "Try Lower Number." 

An exciting feature of the game is the ability to place a bet before each round. If you correctly guess the number, you win 1.75 times the amount you wagered, adding an element of thrill to each guess!Now, I’m looking for creative minds to help design a sleek, user-friendly interface (UI) that elevates the overall experience.

My goal is to transform this game into an website. I’m aiming for a UI that’s not only simple and visually engaging but also easy for players of all skill levels to dive right in.

If you have knowledge of design and desire to contribute, I’d love to collaborate. Additionally, if anyone has suggestions to refine or simplify the core mechanics of the game, your ideas are more than welcome. Let’s work together on this simple project.

~Thank you!
